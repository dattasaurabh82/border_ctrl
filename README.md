A re-interpretation of the struggle travelling around countries with visa issues .. 
What if we have regulations to even visit domain of a different country over internet? 
Because now border regulations are only applied to our physical bodies just (or our actiosn also included) 
but not my digital representative(over skype or hangout etc.) .. What if it would in future??
